Code From Anywhere – $100/month Guide

You don’t need a desk. You don’t need IDE bloat. You don’t need “the setup.”

You need a tunnel, a shell, and a brain.

You could be coding:
    •    on the beach
    •    at a concert
    •    at a boring dinner party
    •    in the back of an Uber
    •    hell, even while you’re “driving” (not recommended but possible)

The Ingredients
    •    A laptop or home computer that never sleeps
    •    Bash shell + SSH installed
    •    Your SSH key (already generated and added to ~/.ssh/)
    •    An SSH client (iTerm, Termius, whatever)
    •    A secure tunnel: WireGuard w/ DynDNS, Tailscale, or Cloudflare Tunnel

The Trick

Install screen or tmux on your always-on machine.
That’s it. That’s the magic.

Example:

ssh user@your-box
cd project-dir
tmux new -s mysession

Inside that session, spin up whatever you want (Claude, vim, server, REPL).
Then detach with ctrl-b d.
Walk away. Close your laptop. Lose internet. Doesn’t matter.

When you’re back:

ssh user@your-box
tmux attach -t mysession

The session never died. Your code is right where you left it.

You just built a persistent workspace in the cloud—except it’s your cloud, not AWS.

Why It Works

Because UNIX doesn’t babysit you. Sessions don’t care if your Wi-Fi drops.
They’ll keep running until you kill them.

Code doesn’t stop. You just drop in and out. Like teleporting.
