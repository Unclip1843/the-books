## Overview

Best practices for using reasoning models effectively.

---

## When to Use Reasoning Models

**Good for:**
- Complex mathematical problems
- Multi-step logical reasoning
- Code debugging and optimization
- Scientific analysis
- Strategic planning

**Not ideal for:**
- Simple queries
- Real-time applications (slower)
- High-volume simple tasks

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Provide Clear Context
```python
# Give the model all necessary information upfront
```

### 2. Allow Extended Reasoning
```python
# Don't constrain max_tokens too tightly
```

### 3. Use for Complex Problems
```python
# Reserve for tasks requiring deep analysis
```
