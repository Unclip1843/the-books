File search
Allow models to search your files for relevant information before generating a response.
File search is a tool available in the Responses API. It enables models to retrieve information in a knowledge base of previously uploaded files through semantic and keyword search. By creating vector stores and uploading files to them, you can augment the models' inherent knowledge by giving them access to these knowledge bases or vector_stores.

To learn more about how vector stores and semantic search work, refer to our retrieval guide.

This is a hosted tool managed by OpenAI, meaning you don't have to implement code on your end to handle its execution. When the model decides to use it, it will automatically call the tool, retrieve information from your files, and return an output.

How to use
Prior to using file search with the Responses API, you need to have set up a knowledge base in a vector store and uploaded files to it.

Create a vector store and upload a file
Once your knowledge base is set up, you can include the file_search tool in the list of tools available to the model, along with the list of vector stores in which to search.

File search tool
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"]
    }]
)
print(response)
When this tool is called by the model, you will receive a response with multiple outputs:

A file_search_call output item, which contains the id of the file search call.
A message output item, which contains the response from the model, along with the file citations.

            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Retrieval customization
Limiting the number of results
Using the file search tool with the Responses API, you can customize the number of results you want to retrieve from the vector stores. This can help reduce both token usage and latency, but may come at the cost of reduced answer quality.

Limit the number of results
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"],
        "max_num_results": 2
    }]
)
print(response)
Include search results in the response
While you can see annotations (references to files) in the output text, the file search call will not return search results by default.

To include search results in the response, you can use the include parameter when creating the response.

Include search results
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input="What is deep research by OpenAI?",
    tools=[{
        "type": "file_search",
        "vector_store_ids": ["<vector_store_id>"]
    }],
    include=["file_search_call.results"]
)
print(response)
Metadata filtering
You can filter the search results based on the metadata of the files. For more details, refer to our retrieval guide, which covers:

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",

        }
    }]

API reference
Retrieval
Search your data using semantic similarity.
The Retrieval API allows you to perform 
semantic search
 over your data, which is a technique that surfaces semantically similar results â€” even when they match few or no keywords. Retrieval is useful on its own, but is especially powerful when combined with our models to synthesize responses.

Retrieval depiction

The Retrieval API is powered by 
vector stores
, which serve as indices for your data. This guide will cover how to perform semantic search, and go into the details of vector stores.

Quickstart
Create vector store and upload files.

Create vector store with files
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

vector_store = client.vector_stores.create(        # Create vector store
    name="Support FAQ",
)

client.vector_stores.files.upload_and_poll(        # Upload file
    vector_store_id=vector_store.id,
    file=open("customer_policies.txt", "rb")
)
Send search query to get relevant results.

Search query
user_query = "What is the return policy?"

results = client.vector_stores.search(
    vector_store_id=vector_store.id,
    query=user_query,
)
To learn how to use the results with our models, check out the synthesizing responses section.

Semantic search
Semantic search is a technique that leverages vector embeddings to surface semantically relevant results. Importantly, this includes results with few or no shared keywords, which classical search techniques might miss.

For example, let's look at potential results for "When did we go to the moon?":

Text	Keyword Similarity	Semantic Similarity
The first lunar landing occurred in July of 1969.	0%	65%
The first man on the moon was Neil Armstrong.	27%	43%
When I ate the moon cake, it was delicious.	40%	28%
(Jaccard used for keyword, cosine with text-embedding-3-small used for semantic.)

Notice how the most relevant result contains none of the words in the search query. This flexibility makes semantic search a very powerful technique for querying knowledge bases of any size.

Semantic search is powered by vector stores, which we cover in detail later in the guide. This section will focus on the mechanics of semantic search.

Performing semantic search
You can query a vector store using the search function and specifying a query in natural language. This will return a list of results, each with the relevant chunks, similarity scores, and file of origin.

Search query
results = client.vector_stores.search(
    vector_store_id=vector_store.id,
    query="How many woodchucks are allowed per passenger?",
)
Results
{
  "object": "vector_store.search_results.page",
  "search_query": "How many woodchucks are allowed per passenger?",
  "data": [
    {
      "file_id": "file-12345",
      "filename": "woodchuck_policy.txt",
      "score": 0.85,
      "attributes": {
        "region": "North America",
        "author": "Wildlife Department"
      },
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "According to the latest regulations, each passenger is allowed to carry up to two woodchucks."
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Ensure that the woodchucks are properly contained during transport."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "file_id": "file-67890",
      "filename": "transport_guidelines.txt",
      "score": 0.75,
      "attributes": {
        "region": "North America",
        "author": "Transport Authority"
      },
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Passengers must adhere to the guidelines set forth by the Transport Authority regarding the transport of woodchucks."
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "has_more": false,
  "next_page": null
}
A response will contain 10 results maximum by default, but you can set up to 50 using the max_num_results param.

Query rewriting
Certain query styles yield better results, so we've provided a setting to automatically rewrite your queries for optimal performance. Enable this feature by setting rewrite_query=true when performing a search.

The rewritten query will be available in the result's search_query field.

Original	Rewritten
I'd like to know the height of the main office building.	primary office building height
What are the safety regulations for transporting hazardous materials?	safety regulations for hazardous materials
How do I file a complaint about a service issue?	service complaint filing process
Attribute filtering
Attribute filtering helps narrow down results by applying criteria, such as restricting searches to a specific date range. You can define and combine criteria in attribute_filter to target files based on their attributes before performing semantic search.

Use comparison filters to compare a specific key in a file's attributes with a given value, and compound filters to combine multiple filters using and and or.

Comparison filter
{
  "type": "eq" | "ne" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte" | "in" | "nin",  // comparison operators
  "key": "attributes_key",                           // attributes key
  "value": "target_value"                             // value to compare against
}
Compound filter
{
  "type": "and" | "or",                                // logical operators
  "filters": [...]                                   
}
Below are some example filters.

Region
Date range
Filenames
Exclude filenames
Complex
Filter for a region
{
  "type": "eq",
  "key": "region",
  "value": "us"
}
Ranking
If you find that your file search results are not sufficiently relevant, you can adjust the ranking_options to improve the quality of responses. This includes specifying a ranker, such as auto or default-2024-08-21, and setting a score_threshold between 0.0 and 1.0. A higher score_threshold will limit the results to more relevant chunks, though it may exclude some potentially useful ones.

Vector stores
Vector stores are the containers that power semantic search for the Retrieval API and the file search tool. When you add a file to a vector store it will be automatically chunked, embedded, and indexed.

Vector stores contain vector_store_file objects, which are backed by a file object.

Object type
Description
file	Represents content uploaded through the Files API. Often used with vector stores, but also for fine-tuning and other use cases.
vector_store	Container for searchable files.
vector_store.file	Wrapper type specifically representing a file that has been chunked and embedded, and has been associated with a vector_store.
Contains attributes map used for filtering.
Pricing
You will be charged based on the total storage used across all your vector stores, determined by the size of parsed chunks and their corresponding embeddings.

Storage	Cost
Up to 1 GB (across all stores)	Free
Beyond 1 GB	$0.10/GB/day
See expiration policies for options to minimize costs.

Attributes
Each vector_store.file can have associated attributes, a dictionary of values that can be referenced when performing semantic search with attribute filtering. The dictionary can have at most 16 keys, with a limit of 256 characters each.

Create vector store file with attributes
client.vector_stores.files.create(
    vector_store_id="<vector_store_id>",
    file_id="file_123",
    attributes={
        "region": "US",
        "category": "Marketing",
        "date": 1672531200      # Jan 1, 2023
    }
)
Expiration policies
You can set an expiration policy on vector_store objects with expires_after. Once a vector store expires, all associated vector_store.file objects will be deleted and you'll no longer be charged for them.

Set expiration policy for vector store
client.vector_stores.update(
    vector_store_id="vs_123",
    expires_after={
        "anchor": "last_active_at",
        "days": 7
    }
)
Limits
The maximum file size is 512 MB. Each file should contain no more than 5,000,000 tokens per file (computed automatically when you attach a file).

Chunking
By default, max_chunk_size_tokens is set to 800 and chunk_overlap_tokens is set to 400, meaning every file is indexed by being split up into 800-token chunks, with 400-token overlap between consecutive chunks.

You can adjust this by setting 
chunking_strategy
 when adding files to the vector store. There are certain limitations to chunking_strategy:

max_chunk_size_tokens must be between 100 and 4096 inclusive.
chunk_overlap_tokens must be non-negative and should not exceed max_chunk_size_tokens / 2.
Supported file types
Synthesizing responses
After performing a query you may want to synthesize a response based on the results. You can leverage our models to do so, by supplying the results and original query, to get back a grounded response.

Perform search query to get results
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

user_query = "What is the return policy?"

results = client.vector_stores.search(
    vector_store_id=vector_store.id,
    query=user_query,
)
Synthesize a response based on results
formatted_results = format_results(results.data)

'\n'.join('\n'.join(c.text) for c in result.content for result in results.data)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "developer",
            "content": "Produce a concise answer to the query based on the provided sources."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Sources: {formatted_results}\n\nQuery: '{user_query}'"
        }
    ],
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
"Our return policy allows returns within 30 days of purchase."
This uses a sample format_results function, which could be implemented like so:

Sample result formatting function
def format_results(results):
    formatted_results = ''
    for result in results.data:
        formatted_result = f"<result file_id='{result.file_id}' file_name='{result.file_name}'>"
        for part in result.content:
            formatted_result += f"<content>{part.text}</content>"
        formatted_results += formatted_result + "</result>"
    return f"<sources>{formatted_results}</sources>"
