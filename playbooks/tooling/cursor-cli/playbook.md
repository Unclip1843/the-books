# Cursor CLI Playbook

## Overview

Drive code edits through Cursorâ€™s CLI/API while pairing with traditional shells or tmux sessions.

## Rubric

See `rubric.md` for acceptance criteria once the tooling is vetted.

## Implementation (TODO)

- [ ] Installation path for macOS/Linux hosts (brew vs. manual binary).
- [ ] Auth & API token handling (environment files, 1Password, Doppler).
- [ ] Example commands for creating/editing files within remote projects.
- [ ] Integration story with tmux panes + SSH (aliases, scripts).
- [ ] Safety rails: dry-run modes, diff previews, logging.
- [ ] Performance considerations over high-latency links.

## Scripts

- Place helper commands (wrappers, installers) in `scripts/`.

## Implementation Assets

- Store config templates, sample responses, or API schemas under `implementation/`.

Capture usage transcripts to help future users understand the flow.
