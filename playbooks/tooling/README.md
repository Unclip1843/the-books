# Tooling Playbooks

Guides for CLI-first coding, assistants, and workflow automation. Each playbook ships with `playbook.md`, `rubric.md`, `scripts/`, and `implementation/`.

- `cursor-cli/` — configure Cursor CLI for remote editing and pair flows (scaffold).
- `agents/` — wire up OpenAI/Claude agents for continuous tasks (scaffold).
- `computer-use/` — end-to-end agent control of machines (scaffold).

Focus each playbook on our opinionated, high-signal defaults rather than exhaustive option lists.
