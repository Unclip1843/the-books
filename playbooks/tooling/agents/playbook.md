# Agent Ops Playbook

## Overview

Build reliable agent pipelines that operate on remote compute, execute shell commands, and coordinate with tmux or container sessions.

## Rubric

Track progress in `rubric.md` to ensure agent safety, observability, and recovery paths meet our standards.

## Implementation (TODO)

- [ ] Catalog supported providers and SDK versions.
- [ ] Secrets management strategy (env vars, vault, Doppler).
- [ ] Reference architecture for task queues + callbacks.
- [ ] Safety policies (allow/deny command lists, resource quotas).
- [ ] Observability hooks (structured logs, tracing, alerts).
- [ ] Recovery flows when agents hang or exceed limits.

## Scripts

- Stage helper CLIs or orchestration scripts in `scripts/`.

## Implementation Assets

- Store Dockerfiles, Terraform, and architecture diagrams in `implementation/`.

Link to concrete scripts or container images as they emerge.
