# Sandboxing Playbooks

Isolation strategies for running untrusted code, demos, or tenant workloads safely. Every playbook adheres to the shared structure (`playbook.md`, `rubric.md`, `scripts/`, `implementation/`).

- `orbstack-multi-tenant/` — orchestrate Mac-native containers with network boundaries (scaffold).

Highlight practical guardrails and automation—we only document what we actually run.
