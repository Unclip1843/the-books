# Implementation Assets

Configs and templates backing the Code From Anywhere workflow.

- `tmux.conf` — opinionated tmux defaults (mouse, history, status line with Tailscale status).
- `ssh/config.home-dev` — sample client entry for the Mac Studio host.
- `ssh/sshd_config.macos` — hardened server settings for `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/`.

Add more assets (e.g., additional client configs) here as the playbook evolves.
