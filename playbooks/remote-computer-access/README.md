# Remote Computer Access Playbooks

Recipes for keeping code-ready environments alive and reachable from anywhere. Every playbook follows the shared structure (`playbook.md`, `rubric.md`, `scripts/`, `implementation/`).

- `code-from-anywhere/` — tmux + secure tunnels = always-on dev box.
- `reverse-ssh/` — expose internal hosts by dialing out to bastions (scaffold).
